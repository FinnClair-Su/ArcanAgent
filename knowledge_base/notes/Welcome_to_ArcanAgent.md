# Welcome to ArcanAgent üîÆ

Welcome to your personal knowledge management and learning system powered by bidirectional linking!

## What is ArcanAgent?

ArcanAgent is built on the principle that **[[Bidirectional Linking]] is All You Need** for effective knowledge management. Just as attention mechanisms revolutionized neural networks, bidirectional links can revolutionize how you learn and organize knowledge.

## Core Philosophy

Drawing inspiration from the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017), we propose that **bidirectional linking** can eliminate the need for complex graph databases and vector stores, just as attention eliminated the need for recurrence and convolution.

## Getting Started

1. **Create Notes**: Write in standard [[Markdown]] format
2. **Link Concepts**: Connect ideas using `[[double brackets]]`
3. **Let ArcanAgent Guide**: The system analyzes your knowledge and guides your learning journey

## Core Learning Concepts

- **[[Zone of Proximal Development]]** - Learn at the right pace for optimal growth
- **[[Cognitive Load Theory]]** - Optimize your mental bandwidth automatically  
- **[[Bidirectional Links]]** - Connect ideas naturally and powerfully
- **[[Spaced Repetition]]** - Reinforce learning through intelligent scheduling

## The Five Arcana üé¥

Your learning journey is guided by five specialized agents, each embodying the wisdom of the Tarot:

### üîÆ The High Priestess
- **Role**: Knowledge Assessment & Cognitive Analysis
- **Wisdom**: "Know thyself" - Deep understanding of your current knowledge state
- **Powers**: Analyzes your existing notes and evaluates your mastery levels

### üèÆ The Hermit  
- **Role**: Learning Path Planning & ZPD Identification
- **Wisdom**: "Seek and you shall find" - Illuminates the path forward
- **Powers**: Finds optimal learning sequences and identifies your next growth areas

### ‚ú® The Magician
- **Role**: Content Generation & Bidirectional Linking
- **Wisdom**: "As above, so below" - Transforms knowledge into understanding
- **Powers**: Creates personalized learning content and weaves new connections

### ‚öñÔ∏è Justice
- **Role**: Understanding Assessment & Learning Evaluation
- **Wisdom**: "Truth shall set you free" - Honest assessment of comprehension
- **Powers**: Tests understanding fairly and provides targeted feedback

### üå∏ The Empress
- **Role**: Memory Consolidation & Knowledge Integration
- **Wisdom**: "Nurture growth" - Cultivates lasting understanding
- **Powers**: Integrates new knowledge into your existing mental models

## Mathematical Beauty

Our system follows elegant mathematical principles:

```
Granularity = f(incoming_links, outgoing_links)
Context_Quality = Œ£(shortest_paths) √ó neighborhood_expansion
Learning_Readiness = |prerequisites ‚à© known_concepts| / |prerequisites|
```

Where content granularity automatically adapts based on link patterns, eliminating the need for manual knowledge engineering.

## Getting Started with Your First Session

Ready to begin your learning journey? Here's how:

1. **Explore** what you'd like to learn about
2. **Create notes** about topics that interest you
3. **Link concepts** using `[[double brackets]]`
4. **Start a learning session** through the ArcanAgent interface
5. **Follow the guidance** of the Five Arcana

## Example Learning Flow

Let's say you want to learn about [[Artificial Intelligence]]:

1. **The High Priestess** analyzes your current knowledge of [[Machine Learning]], [[Neural Networks]], and related concepts
2. **The Hermit** plans a learning path from basic [[Algorithms]] to advanced [[Deep Learning]]
3. **The Magician** generates content about [[Supervised Learning]] tailored to your level
4. **Justice** tests your understanding with practical examples
5. **The Empress** integrates this knowledge with your existing understanding of [[Computer Science]]

## Your Knowledge Garden üå±

Think of your knowledge base as a living garden:
- **Notes are plants** - They grow and flourish with attention
- **Links are pathways** - They connect different areas of your garden
- **ArcanAgent is your gardener** - Helping you tend and cultivate wisely

## Next Steps

- Explore the [[ArcanAgent API]] to understand the technical capabilities
- Learn about [[Context Engineering]] principles that make the system efficient
- Discover how [[Learning Science]] informs every aspect of the system
- Start building your own knowledge network with meaningful [[Bidirectional Links]]
